# Introduction
This project utilizes **Diffusion Models** for **unsupervised generation** and recognition of handwritten text. The main objective is to use a powerful diffusion-based approach to generate synthetic handwritten digits or text, and to recognize these generated samples without relying on labeled data.

The Diffusion Model is trained to gradually transform a random noise image into a handwritten character (or series of characters) through a series of iterative steps, ultimately generating realistic and coherent handwriting samples.

This model works on the premise of **unsupervised learning**, meaning it can generate and recognize handwritten characters without the need for manually labeled data.

### Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and several dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:
